    <p>Title:  Project SEAS: Smart Environmental Awareness System via Buoy Monitoring for  Marine Sanctuaries</p>
    <p><h3>Rationale:</h3></p>
    <p style="color: black;">   Protecting marine sanctuaries in the Philippines poses significant challenges due to their remote and often hard-to-reach locations. The Philippines, with its vast and biodiverse marine ecosystems, faces threats such as illegal fishing, pollution, and habitat destruction. These remote locations make it difficult to deploy monitoring resources, conduct regular inspections, and respond quickly to environmental threats. </p>

           <p> To address these challenges, the deployment of smart buoys offers an innovative and effective solution tailored to the specific needs of the Philippines. These smart buoys are powered by solar energy, allowing them to operate autonomously for extended periods without the need for frequent maintenance or external power sources. This is particularly beneficial in the Philippines, where many marine sanctuaries are situated far from population centers and traditional power grids. </p>
        
            <p>The smart buoy aims to monitor remote marine environments with precision. It  transmits detailed data to a centralized server using a LoRaWAN connection, ensuring reliable and long-range communication. In addition to data transmission, these buoys are equipped to detect and respond to threats and abnormalities in their surroundings. </p>
        
            <p>By utilizing these advanced technologies, smart buoys can effectively enhance the protection and management of marine sanctuaries in the Philippines. They provide a cost-effective, sustainable solution.

        <p><h3>B. Research Questions or Problems Being Addressed</h3>
            The study aims to tackle several pressing challenges faced by marine sanctuaries, including their remote and difficult-to-access locations that hinder effective monitoring. It addresses the need for enhanced surveillance and data collection by deploying buoy-based monitoring systems. These systems help overcome obstacles such as limited on-site personnel, irregular patrols, and delayed response times. By providing real-time alerts and transmitting crucial data to a central server, the system also combats threats like illegal fishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and unauthorized resource extraction. Furthermore, it enhances the ability to track environmental changes, assess the health of marine ecosystems, and support sustainable management practices, ensuring timely interventions and more effective conservation efforts.
